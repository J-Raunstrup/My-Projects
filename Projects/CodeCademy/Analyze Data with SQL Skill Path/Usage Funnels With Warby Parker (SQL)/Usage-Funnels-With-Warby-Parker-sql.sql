--actionable insights: it seems that there are more people buying glasses when they can try on 5 pairs. 
--However we dont know if this is too expensive for the buisness to ship or if there are some hidden expense we dont know about. 
--We also haven't calculated if that specific cost will make 5 instead of 3 pairs per trial justifiable. Though just looking at glass sales.
